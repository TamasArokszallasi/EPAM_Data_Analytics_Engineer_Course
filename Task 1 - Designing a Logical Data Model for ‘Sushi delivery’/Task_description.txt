You bought a small sushi restaurant, taking orders for preparation and delivery.
You have at your disposal a staff of couriers providing delivery of orders.
Your task is to design a logical data model for storing/processing information about accepted orders and their delivery details

Order data (composition, cost, time of acceptance of the order, etc.)
Delivery information (delivery time, delivery address - district, street, etc.)
Courier data
Any other information on the topic is at your discretion
The model should be in 3rd normal form (3NF)
Your model should include at least 10-15 tables (relations)
Keys and other constraints should be specified

Feel free to use whichever design tool you prefer. Here are several examples to choose from:
draw.io (recommended)
PgModeler.io
drawSQL
StarUML (for the guideline address the video ER Diagram)
