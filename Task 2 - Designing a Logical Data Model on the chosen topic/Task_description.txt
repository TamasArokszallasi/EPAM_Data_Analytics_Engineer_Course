Your task is to design a logical data model for one of the specified subject areas based on the requirements for a database

The model should be in 3rd normal form (3NF).
Your model should include 10-15 tables (relations).
Your model should include at least one many-to-many relationship (think about how to implement this relationship).
All relationships  should be graphically indicated on the diagram
Сheck that the visualization of relationship matches the logic
The correct data types should be specified.
Keys and other constraints should be specified.
The names of the tables and columns should be clear (adhere to the coding standards).
