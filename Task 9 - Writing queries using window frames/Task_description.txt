Task 1

Create a query for analyzing the annual sales data for the years 1999 to 2001, focusing on different sales channels and regions: 'Americas,' 'Asia,' and 'Europe.' 
The resulting report should contain the following columns:
AMOUNT_SOLD: This column should show the total sales amount for each sales channel
% BY CHANNELS: In this column, we should display the percentage of total sales for each channel (e.g. 100% - total sales for Americas in 1999, 63.64% - percentage of sales for the channel “Direct Sales”)
% PREVIOUS PERIOD: This column should display the same percentage values as in the '% BY CHANNELS' column but for the previous year
% DIFF: This column should show the difference between the '% BY CHANNELS' and '% PREVIOUS PERIOD' columns, indicating the change in sales percentage from the previous year.
The final result should be sorted in ascending order based on three criteria: first by 'country_region,' then by 'calendar_year,' and finally by 'channel_desc'

Task 2

You need to create a query that meets the following requirements:
Generate a sales report for the 49th, 50th, and 51st weeks of 1999.
Include a column named CUM_SUM to display the amounts accumulated during each week.
Include a column named CENTERED_3_DAY_AVG to show the average sales for the previous, current, and following days using a centered moving average.
For Monday, calculate the average sales based on the weekend sales (Saturday and Sunday) as well as Monday and Tuesday.
For Friday, calculate the average sales on Thursday, Friday, and the weekend.


Ensure that your calculations are accurate for the beginning of week 49 and the end of week 51.
