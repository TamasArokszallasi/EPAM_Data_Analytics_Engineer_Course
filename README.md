# EPAM_Data_Analytics_Engineer_Course
I have enrolled in the EPAM's Data Analytics Engineer Start + programme in 2024 Q1.

In this repository i have uploaded all the tasks that i did by myself and those i have submitted during the learning period.
If you go into each folder, you will find a file with the "Task_description" name where you can find the details what was needed for the task, and the other files are  the ones which i provided as a solution.


**About the program**
The main challenge of the Data Analytics is to prepare a reliable infrastructure for data extraction, transformation, loading, processing and visualization. Therefore, it is so important to understand the Database and speak the same language with it.
The program is the set of practice tasks, which have various solutions, allowing trainees the freedom to propose and implement effective solutions. During this program, participants will work both with existing Databases and ones they have modeled.
