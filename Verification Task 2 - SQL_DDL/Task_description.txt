Task 1 . Develop a database to track and manage the workloads, capacities, and operations of healthcare facilities within our city. 

The database should include information about each institution, such as their location, staff, available resources, capabilities (the amount of patients that given institution can handle daily), and records of patient visits.

Your database must be in 3NF and includes 6+ tables
Use appropriate data types for each column and apply DEFAULT values, and GENERATED ALWAYS AS columns as required.
Create relationships between tables using primary and foreign keys.
Apply three check constraints (including NOT NULL) across the tables to restrict certain values
Populate the tables with the sample data generated, ensuring each table has at least 5+ rows (for a total of 30+ rows in all the tables) for the last 3 months.


Note:
Please pay attention that your code must be reusable and rerunnable and executes without errors.
Add comments (as example why you chose particular constraint, datatytpe, etc.)



Task 2. Write a sql query

 Find doctors who have had a workload of fewer than 5 patients per each month over the last two months (current and previous).
